This level is pretty trivial. The main point here is that commands get
tripped up when the filenames are wierd.

You can always use the `tab` key on your keyboard to auto-complete a
filename. Otherwise, you have to escape special chracters like `space` using
the `\` character.

In general, you should follow these best practices when naming files on a *nix commands. These aren't hard rules but they can help you avoid snags when working with file later (such as scripting or reading files in a program).

* Name all your files lower case.
* Instead of using a space, use an `_` or a `–`
* Don't use [special characters](https://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashGuide/SpecialCharacters) in file names. Only alphanumeric characters, periods, underscores and hyphens and don’t use symbols like `%`, `$`, and so forth.
* Keep the file names short and descriptive.
